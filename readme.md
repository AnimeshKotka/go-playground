### Building a Go Program
To build a Go program, run the following command:
```bash
go build
```
This command will locate the `main.go` file and compile the program based on the `GOOS` (Go Operating System) environment variable settings.

### Memory Management
Go handles memory management through a garbage collector, which automatically frees up memory that is no longer in use, reducing the need for manual memory management.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Go
Go does not have traditional OOP features like inheritance, super, or encapsulation. However, Go supports some OOP principles through interfaces and structs. Instead of inheritance, Go uses composition to achieve code reuse and polymorphism.

### Go Modules
- **`go.mod`**: This file is analogous to `package.json` in JavaScript. It manages dependencies for your Go project.
  
- To download a dependency, use:
  ```bash
  go get -u <package>
  ```
  The downloaded package will be stored in the Go environment's cache and referenced from there.
  
- **`go.sum`**: This file is automatically generated alongside `go.mod` and contains checksums for the module's dependencies. To verify the integrity of the downloaded packages, use:
  ```bash
  go mod verify
  ```

- **`go mod tidy`**: This command cleans up the `go.mod` file by removing any dependencies that are no longer used in the project.
